Free Simple Server - DEV
===

Free Simple Server is a C server under development!

It uses threads for handling client connections and dealing packets through client to client and the server.

You can choose to use either TPC or UDP protocols, the server is filled up with both protocols.

The main idea is to easyly integrate the server with another programs like online games, web servers and
many others offering easy configurable packets and an easy packet manager.
